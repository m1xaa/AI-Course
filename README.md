# Harvard's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

Welcome to my repository for Harvard's course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python." This course introduces the foundational concepts of artificial intelligence, focusing on the use of Python for AI programming. Below, you'll find a brief explanation of each lesson covered in the course.

## Course Outline

### Lesson 1: Search
In this lesson, we explore the concept of search algorithms, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search. These algorithms are fundamental to AI and help in solving problems by finding optimal paths.

### Lesson 2: Knowledge
This lesson introduces knowledge representation and logical reasoning. We delve into propositional logic, predicate logic, and how to use logic to make inferences.

### Lesson 3: Uncertainty
Here, we tackle the concept of uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning. Topics include Bayesian networks, conditional probability, and how to handle uncertain information in AI systems.

### Lesson 4: Optimization
This lesson focuses on optimization problems and techniques such as linear programming and hill climbing. Optimization is crucial for improving the efficiency and performance of AI models.

### Lesson 5: Learning
In this lesson, we cover the basics of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning. We look at different types of algorithms, such as decision trees, neural networks, and clustering techniques.

### Lesson 6: Neural Networks
This lesson dives deep into neural networks and deep learning. We learn about the structure of neural networks, backpropagation, and how to train models for various tasks like image and speech recognition.

### Lesson 7: Language
We explore natural language processing (NLP) in this lesson, focusing on how AI can understand and generate human language. Topics include tokenization, parsing, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.
